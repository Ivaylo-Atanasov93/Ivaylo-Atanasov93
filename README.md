- âš¡ Fun story:
--> A programmers wife told him to go to the near by shop and buy some stuff. She tells him:
      - Buy a bottle of milk, if there are eggs in the shop, buy ten.
    After a while the programmer is coming back home with 10 bottles of milk...
    His wife:
      - Why did you buy 10 bottles of milk ?!
    The programmer:
      - Because there were eggs in the shop, what do you mean why ?!
